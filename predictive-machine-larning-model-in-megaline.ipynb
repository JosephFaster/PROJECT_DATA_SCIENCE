However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the trained model (80%) greatly exceeds both the strategy of assuming that everyone chooses the Smart plan (69%) and the accuracy of the sanity test (57.54%). This indicates that the model has learned meaningful features of the data set and is making more informed predictions than strategies based on assumptions or random assignments."

    "**General Conclusions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Distribution**: The data set provided by Megaline has a clear bias towards the Smart plan, with approximately 70% of users choosing it, while 30% opt for the Ultra plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Performance**: The Random Forest model, after being optimized with suitable hyperparameters, proved to be the most effective with an accuracy of around 80% on the validation set. This accuracy exceeds the threshold set by Megaline of 0.75, indicating that the model is suitable for the classification task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sanity Test**: By performing a sanity test based on the proportion of users of each plan, an accuracy of approximately 57.54% was obtained. This figure is lower than the accuracy of the trained model, which supports the effectiveness of the developed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison with Simple Strategies**: Although the model performs well, it is essential to keep in mind that a simple strategy of assuming that all users opt for the Smart plan could achieve an accuracy of around 69%. However, the trained model still outperforms this simple strategy, demonstrating its ability to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relevance to Megaline**: The model's ability to accurately predict the plan a user might choose based on their behavior is valuable to Megaline. It allows the company to direct marketing strategies and personalized offers to users, potentially increasing adoption of its most premium plans (Ultra) and improving customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project has demonstrated the ability of machine learning models to address real-world classification problems and provide valuable solutions to businesses."
